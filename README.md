Following checks were done:
in 1a preparation: checking the 2023 data:
a)	Check of new species: species occurred for the first time in 2023. Check of plausibility. 11 new species.
b)	Check number of plots surveyed in 2023 and compare with orig. forms: 685 plots were recorded (5 of this empty plots)
c)	Check, if cover of species and number of species per plot are plausible
d)	Check, if species are entered correctly, when there are more species of the same genus: When entering the data, species where listed alphabetically and therefore there is a risk of wrong entries. Checked with orig Forms.

in 2a crossMOCY: Cross-records-checks:
a)	Check species occurrence between surveys (in all 4 years (194, 2004, 2014 and 2023): 355 plots; in the years 1994, 2014 and 2023: 661 plots), especially, when same species from same genus alternating: Checked with orig. forms and with pictures, if possible.
b)	Quite some altering data between some genus pairs even after checks: Poa alpine – Poa laxa: However, both are very common and occurred a lot of times together on plots. To this, we observed a decrease of Poa laxa, whereas Poa alpi is increasing. Saxifraga androsacea – Saxifraga seguides: Can be hard to distinguish, when they are small, vegetative examples.
Checks of position changes of plots in 2023, especially in SW transects (1-5):
a)	361 were checked by comparing the pictures of 1994 and 2023 (and in difficult cases even years between). Assigned to a category (0-3; see describtion in the access tool) and documented in the table: tabPlotsCategoryChange in the Access-DB
